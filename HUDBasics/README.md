 # HUDBasics FiveM script including HUD, Priorities, and more.  Ensure the value for dependency in the fxmanifest.lua file is the name of your postal script resource.  All other edits to the code should be done in the config.lua. Unless you know what you're doing, don't mess with any of the other files.  Certain functions used in the code (specifically those used for the cardinal direction display) were written by Badger, check out his GitHub: https://github.com/JaredScar  Never really intended to release this publically so it may be rough around the edges.
