# HUDBasics
FiveM script including HUD, Priorities, and more.  

Provided is a postal script made by DevBlocky (with some slight modifications by me), check out his work here: https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal

All other edits to the code should be done in the config.lua. Unless you know what you're doing, don't mess with any of the other files.  

Certain functions used in the code (specifically those used for the cardinal direction display) were written by Badger, check out his GitHub: https://github.com/JaredScar  

Never really intended to release this publically so it may be rough around the edges.
